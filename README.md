# Unsupervised Learning with Python
Unsupervised learning is useful and practical in many circumstances where labelled data is not available. Readers of this course aim to learn how and where to apply unsupervised learning techniques, as well as best practices from a practical implementation point of view.


## What you will learn
* Learn where to apply unsupervised learning, with practical examples.
* Learn which unsupervised learning algorithm to apply to what problem.
* Gain practical experience solving various unsupervised learning problems in Python.
